# Battlecodes

### What is it?
Battlecodes is a real-time multiplayer game inspired by Codewars, where players race against each other to solve code challenges.

Players can either host a new game and choose the challenge, or they can join an existing 'open' game. The first player to submit a correct solution wins the round!
